# 🎯 Goal

- **Input**: Markdown files (e.g. blog posts)
- **Output**: Static HTML files that cn be deployed as web pages (or part of a web app)
- **Mechanism**: Static Site Generation (SSG) by Next.js
- **Added value**:
  1. MD files can be versioned in Git
  2. They can be edited in any text editor (easy even for non-developers)
  3. They can be edited by multiple contributors
  4. The generated HTML files are cached on the server => better performance for the website that embeds them

## 🔑 Use Cases

1. Generating the HTML content then integrating it into a web app
2. Making a deployable static website (i.e. a complete HTML page with head tags, etc.)

# 💡 Design Choices

## Criteria

1. Simplicity of implementation
2. Ease of use and editing of articles (for non-developers)
3. UI elegance (modern look and feel)
4. Performance and optimization of the generated HTML files

## Options

### Framework

Nextjs and Astro are 2 possible frameworks to use for this project. **Nextjs** was chosen just because I knew it better.

### UI Libraries

**Tailwind CSS** is chosen as the defacto standard for React / Next apps. **Shadcn** / **Radix** are easily parsed and generated by AI tools.

### MDX usage

Should we use md or mdx here?
