# Getting Started

Welcome to the first post in this example series! This demonstrates how the new folder hierarchy feature works.

## What is a Series?

A series is a collection of related blog posts that are meant to be read in sequence. With the new feature, you can:

- Organize posts in folders
- Get automatic prev/next navigation
- Display series information on listing pages
- Create dedicated series overview pages

## How It Works

This post is located at `content/blog/example-series/01-getting-started.md`. The folder name "example-series" automatically creates a series called "Example Series".

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll explore advanced features and customization options.
