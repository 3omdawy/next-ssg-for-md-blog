# Advanced Usage

Welcome to the second post in our example series! Let's explore some advanced features.

## Custom Ordering

You can control the order of posts in a series using the `seriesOrder` field in your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
seriesOrder: 3
---
```

## Series Navigation

Notice the prev/next links at the bottom of this post? They automatically link to adjacent posts in the series.

## Series Pages

Visit `/series` to see all available series, or `/series/example-series` to see all posts in this series.

## Mixing Content

You can freely mix standalone posts (in the root blog directory) with series posts (in subdirectories). They work together seamlessly!

## Conclusion

This wraps up our example series. Try creating your own series by organizing posts in folders!
